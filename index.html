					## UTEK 2018 Programming

					![utek logo](resources/logo.svg)

					2018-01-13 / 2018-01-14

					---

					### This year's competition will use:

					- String processing
					- Discrete optimization

					---

					### Before the competition

					#### Required
					- Register if you haven't
					- Set up your developer environment (local, ECF, Google cloud)
					- [Create a Github account](https://github.com/)

					#### Optional
					- [Install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
					- [Create a Google cloud account. Required if you don't have ECF access](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial?page=0)

					Note:
					Github account required to ask questions: open an issue. I will also be tracking revision history of the competition package there
					Ask who is not in engineering

					--

					### At the competition

					You will need to create:
					- A program (obviously), that will need to pass various test cases
					- An 8 minute presentation
					- Optional visualization component

					---

					### Optimization

					What is discrete optimization?

					What algorithms can we use?

					Note:

					Talk briefly about hill climbing and simulated annealing on the board
					- Hill climbing
					- Ant colony optimization
					- Simulated annealing

					--

					### Exercise

					You have a csv file (`exercises/optimization/terrain.txt`) containing a 100x100 2d array. Find the largest possible value in the array, inspecting fewer than 1000 values. Use one of the methods from before.

					- Try using multiple seeds. Does this improve the results more than optimizing for longer?
					- Now try finding the minimum value

					Note:
					The max is 0.492
					The min is -0.246

					---

					### String Processing

					Reading, breaking, creating, modifying strings

					--

					### Exercise: Pig Latin translator

					igpay atinlay anslatortay
					```
					If the word begins with a consonant:
					    [first consonant cluster][rest of word]
					        -> [rest of word][first consonant cluster] + "ay"
					    pig -> ig + p + ay
					    train -> ain + tr + ay

					Else:
					    [word] -> [word] + "way"
					    egg -> egg + way
					```

					--

					### Exercise cont.

					You have a list of input sentences (`exercises/string_processing/words.txt`). Write a program that outputs the pig latin translation of each.

					- Carry any punctation e.g. `hello! -> ellohay`
					- Carry the capitalization of each word (UPPER, Title or lower) e.g. `ONE two Three -> ONEWAY otway Eetray`
					- Assume that "I" and "A" are in title case.

					Note:
					there are lots of weird cases that haven't been properly covered, but this is just an exercise


					--

					### Creating a Google Cloud account
					- Go to the [Google cloud page](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances)
					- Create a project and an instance, using the default settings EXCEPT use an f1 instance (the free tier :) )
					- Go to VM instances, click Connect. This will open an SSH shell
					- You will need a credit card to set this up

					Note:
					People in engineering can leave if they are planning to use ECF

					--

					#### OS details
					- Debian 6.3.0
					- Python 2.7.13 and 3.5.3 are installed by default

					#### Required
					- Install git with `sudo apt-get install git`

					If you install anything else, you must provide installation instructions so that I can reproduce your results.

					--

					- You can sync your files to the VM using:
					    - Git (recommended)
					    - Or you can use [Google's cloud storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-basics)

					- Documentation
					    - https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-start-instance
					    - https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance

					--

					Exercise:

					Create an instance and install git. Then clone this repo.

					`git clone https://github.com/utek-2018/training-session.git`

					Note:
					The competition package will be uploaded to this project

					### See you at Mars
